<h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
<p>An ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system is a software solution that integrates and manages core business processes and functions across an organization. It serves as a centralized platform for managing various aspects of business operations, including finance, human resources, supply chain, manufacturing, inventory, sales, and customer relationship management.</p>
<p>I have made an ERP sytem for a hypothetical lighting enterprise named "Gautam Lighting Solutions". This ERP system has mainly three pages or components namely
<ol><li>Dashboard: This page mainly contains summary of the enterprise like number of products, total number of customers or total sales etc. It also contains widgets like <ul><li>Clock for current date and time,</li> <li>Todo list for managing tasks,</li> <li>Charts for better understanding and visualization.</li><li>Calendar to keep tracks of date and month and it also helps users to keep track of pending orders as it indicates pending orders on respective dates.</li></ul></li>
