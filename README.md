<li><p>Product Management: This page has list of different products. User has the feature to add/edit/delete a product.</p></li>
<li><p>Order Management: This page has list of orders with details such as Customer Name, Product Ordered, Order Date etc. User has the feature to view order details, change status of order, or delete the order from the list.</p></li></ol>
